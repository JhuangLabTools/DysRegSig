CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.2
-------------------------
    o Add the fitness function fitness.AUC() for building signature for binary cancer phenotypes.   	
	 
    o Optimize functions DysReg, DiffCor, combineDysreg to show the running progression.   	
	 
    o Optimize the descriptions of parameters.
	 
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.1
-------------------------
    o Add an alternative method for construct conditional GRN, RGBM.
      
    o Add the choices for differential expression analysis. Users could 
	  offer their own differential expression gene list 
	  in function DysReg and DiffCorplus.
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
-------------------------
    o Add function combineDysreg(). This function explores the best conbination 
	  of dysregulations for building predictive signature with mechanistic 
	  interpretability by using genetic algorithm.
	  
	o Add the fitness function fitness.Cindex() for building signature for prognosis.      

	o Add function RankDysReg().  
	  
	o Add function RankDysTF().
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.0
------------------------
    o Add function DiffCor().
	  
	o Add function DiffCorPlus().  
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
------------------------
    o Build funciton condiGRN() for building conditional GRN by using Boruta algorithm. 
      
    o Build function quantiReg() for quantifying regualtory intensity and its confidence interal.
	  
	o Build function DysReg() for implement gene dysregulation analysis.
	  
	o Build function plotDysregExp() for visualizing the expression pattern 
	  of a dysregulation between conditions.
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: For differential regulation, de-based LASSO is 
      used to quantified regualtory intensity and its confidence 
	  interal. If if 95%, or user defined other, confidence intervals 
	  of the regression coefficient have no overlap between two conditions, 
	  the regulatory intensity could be regarded as significantly differential.
	  

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use random forest-based feature selection algorithm Boruta to 
	  build condtional GRN.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use LASSO to build condtional GRN and quantify the regualtory intensity.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
-------------------------
    o Update the refence gene regulatory network (GRN). Collect TF list and TF motifs datasets 
	  from humanTF database. Use FIMO to predict the potential binding site of all protein-coding 
	  genes. The TF-target links output from FIMO after multi-hypothesis test correction was 
	  composed the reference GRN.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use student t distribution to replace boostrapping to 
	  speed up the running rate.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
    o Workflow: Propose a strategy for gene dysregulation analysis, which integrates 
      three aspects of information regarding change of regulatory intensity, change of
	  target  expression, and the regulatory contribution of regulator to target. The 
	  change of regulatory intensity was quantified by coefficient and its standard error 
	  exported from step-wise regression. Bootstrapping was used to identify the regulations 
	  whose regulatory intensity is significantly changed. More details could be found 
	  in the publication: 
	  Differential regulation analysis reveals dysfunctional regulatory mechanism 
	  involving transcription factors and microRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis.
