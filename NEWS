CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.1
-------------------------
    o Add the one other method for construct conditional GRN, RGBM.
      
    o Add the choose for differential expression analysis.
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
-------------------------
    o Add function combineDysreg(). This function implementat conbination 
	  of dysregulations for building predictive signature with genetic algorithm.
	  
	o Add function RankDysreg().  
	  
	o Add function RankDysTF().
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.0
------------------------
    o Add function DiffCor().
	  
	o Add function DiffCorplus().  
	  

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
------------------------
    o Build funciton condiGRN() for building conditional GRN by using Boruta algorithm. 
      
    o Build function quantiReg().
	  
	o Build function DysReg().
	  
	o Build function plotDysregExp().
	  
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: For differential regulation, de-based LASSO is 
      used to quantified regualtory intensity and its confidential 
	  interal. If if 95%, or user defined other, confidence intervals 
	  of the regression coefficient have no overlap between normal and 
	  cancer conditions, the regulatory intensity could be regarded as 
	  significantly differential.
	  

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use Boruta to to feature selection before regression.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use LASSO to to feature selection before regression.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
-------------------------
    o Update the refence gene regulatory network from humanTF database.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0
-------------------------
    o Optimization: use student distribution to replace boostrap.
      
	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
    o Workflow: Propose a gene dysregulation framework, which integrates 
      three aspects of information regarding differential regulation,
	  differential expression and the regulation contribution of regulator 
	  to target. Specifically, for the differential regulation, the diffence 
	  of regulatory intensity is quantified based on step-wise regression.
	  Bootstrap is used to the regulations whose regulatory intensity is 
	  significantly changed. See Li, Q., et al, Differential regulation 
	  analysis reveals dysfunctional regulatory mechanism involving 
	  transcription factors and microRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis.
